Database Model Concept
Player Name: Represented in Characters
Player Team: represented in Characters

If the dates are the keys, then the database would consist of a date, which teams played,
the score, which players scored, assisted, got penalties, which won and which didn't.

We will call this the primary input filter. 

Date, time, team1[player, goal, assist, penalty], team2[player, goal, assist, penalty], winning team.

All information that is kept on a score sheet. 
In which case you need to have the information stored in a way that allows your algorithm to access this information quickly. 

Perhaps running in the background and creating these information sets in the background while the front is only there to display the information that has already been sorted on the server side.
