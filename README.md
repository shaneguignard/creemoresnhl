# Csnhl-Re-Design
A recreational hockey league made up of 6 teams who play on Sunday nights in Creemore, Ontario, Canada. 

Initially started as a way to update the existing system by making it mobile friendly, and upgrading the backend system used to update the website, the project has evolved to become a template and example of how we can leverage web technologies to make the planning, scorekeeping, and game processes as simple as possible. 

This is the website and backend code developed to support the league and future integration into other recreational and minor sports leagues around the province.
