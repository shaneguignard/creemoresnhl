            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                This was a four team league that started in October 2010.
                <br> The effort to form a league on Sunday nights in Creemore resulted from several groups of local pick up hockey players wanting to form teams and play organized games. There is a wide range of ages and skill levels. Games were three running fifteen minute periods, with games times of 8 and 9pm
            </p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <h4>Arena Rules</h4>
            <p>
                <i><b>Arena rules</b></i> must be respected. We need to vacate the premises according to their wishes. Our ice times are on loan from Creemore minor hockey association who use the ice prior to ours. We need to have a good relationship with the operators of the facility and the CMHA if we wish to continue in future years.
            </p>
            <h4>Referees</h4>
            <p>
                <i><b>DO NOT MOUTH OFF TO THE REFS.</b></i> We can't operate without them so be prepared to stifle yourself and/ or your team-mates.
            </p>

            <h2>Games</h2>

            <p>
                Games will be three running time 15 minutes periods, played during one hour less flood and a short warm-up. If the score difference is three or less, stop time will occur during the last three minutes.</p>

            <p>
                Games will be three 15 minute periods of stop time. There will be a flood every 2 periods over the 2 games. If the score difference is more than 3 goals the clock will run. If the score is tied at the end of the game, a 5 minute <b>sudden death overtime</b> period will be played 5 on 5 with all other regular league rules. If the score is still tied we will play 1 minute buzzer time intervals starting with 4 on 4 and reducing a player each time. There will be no changing on the fly. If the score is still tied at the end of this 4 minute overtime we will have a shoot-out. Each team will be give three shots. After each team has taken three shots, if the score remains tied, the shoot-out will proceed to a "Sudden Death" format. No player May shoot twice until everyone who is eligible has shot.
